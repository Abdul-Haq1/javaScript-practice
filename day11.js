// array elements can be accessed by using array indexing

// Bracket notation: You can use square brackets to access the elements of an array by their index. The index starts at 0 for the first element,
  // and increases by 1 for each subsequent element. For example, myArray[0] would return the first element of the array.
function getFirstValue(arr) {
	return arr[0];
